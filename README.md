# Chess CLI
This is a CLI (command-line interface) for chess. That means that you can play proper chess in the
terminal, without that GUI nonsense. This is merely an interface to the chess library I've made
[here](https://github.com/kalkins/rust_chess).

## How to use
First, [clone][] this repo to a local folder. Then, install [rust][]. Now, use a terminal or commandline
to navigate to the folder you cloned the repo, and run the command `cargo run`. The program will now
download dependencies, compile, and then run. When you are in the game you use [algebraic notation][]
to move your pieces.
